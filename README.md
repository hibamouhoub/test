# Welcome
Thanks for applying to Vyte. If we've sent you this exercise, you've already made it through the first step of our selection process so congrats!

## How to use this repo
 * Clone it (don't fork it)
 * Solve the challenges and commit at least once per level (more if you think it's appropriate)
 * Zip it and send it back to us (make sure to include the `.git` folder)

## What we expect
 * Solve this challenges in Javascript (ES6 / ES2015 and later versions will be appreciated).
 * If you have a question or think something needs clarification, just make a reasonable assumption and explain it as a comment in your code.
 * We don't expect you to build an HTTP API around those classes or to plug an actual database to them.
 * We require you to complete at least level 1-3, though level 4 is expected. Level 5 is a bonus is you have time to spare (and always a good practice)
