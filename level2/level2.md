We want to accept several people per appointment.

Improve the `Appointment` class with
 * [ ] a maxAttendees property
 * [ ] a `remainingSpots()` method that return the number of Attendees that can still register
 * [ ] an `isAvailable()` method that returns true if the appointment hasn't started yet and still has at least one remaining spot. False otherwise.
 * [ ] an `isConfirmed()` property that returns true if the event has at least one attendee.
