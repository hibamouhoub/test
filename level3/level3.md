Now that we have appointments, we need a calendar to store them.
Implement a `Calendar` class with the following methods:
 * [ ] `getAppointmentById(id)`
 * [ ] `saveAppointment(appointment)` This method should assign to the appointment a new id that hasn't been used yet by any other appointment and return the appointment.
 * [ ] `deleteAppointmentById(id)`
 * [ ] `getAppointmentsBetweenDates(startDate, endDate)` where `startDate` and `endDate` are javascript `Date` objects







For this to work you'll need to add properties. We'll leave the details of that implementation to you.
